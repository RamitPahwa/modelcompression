\section{Conclusion}
This paper presents an automated systematic approach to compress a neural network for designing resource-efficient mobile feature extraction models using reinforcement learning.
The key idea behind this method is to incorporate real-world latency information into reward function to make the search process more efficient and search for mobile models with the best trade-offs between accuracy, compression and latency.
We demonstrate that our approach can automatically find significantly better mobile models than existing approaches as well as we provide support towards effectiveness of transfer learning across datasets.
